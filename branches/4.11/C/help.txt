        This is a tool that has been written to enhance the ability the mouse
cursors for DOS - in graphics mode. Basically, mouse cursors are changed by
int 33h, (service 9). This requires a pointer to the bitmap in the CX and DX
registers. This bitmap consists of a screen mask and a cursor mask.
        The cursor mask bitmap is copied onto the screen, while the screen
mask is XORed with the screen contents (to restore screen contents on removing
the mouse form a position). This allows the user to have creative and cool
cursors to appeal for theis DOS based applications. The code required to
change the cursor is appended to the required file and can be cut from that
location.
        Also supplied is a <MOUSE.H> header file that wraps almost all the 
mouse interrupts, in a programmable format. To the changecursor(...) function
pass the char word[64]; value that actually represents.


The cursor library is
cursor.c
